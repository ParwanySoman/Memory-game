# Memory-game

# The exercise 
We got the exercise to make a memory game of our own. The meaning of the game is to try to memorize where the different cards are located. Then the player needs to put two identical cards face up to win the game. The end of the game is when all pairs are found.

# Learning objectives
- Change things in the DOM (Aka canvas = cheating)
- React to keypresses
- Collision detection

# Time 
The time we got for this exercise was 5 days. 

# Experience
I had a little bit of trouble with this exercise, so I used a tutorial for this. I do understand the lines of codes and could make it all over again just by myself. 

# Pending
- Lay out
- Cards
